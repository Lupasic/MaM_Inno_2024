Warning from the driver element "MOTION_J001_RZ".
The curve referenced by this driver, named "AFUREC_test_vehicle_torque_motion1.afu#trapez",
uses linear interpolation.  Use of linear interpolation in driver curves is
not recommended for two reasons:  First, the second derivative of such curves
is zero, which will result in an imposed acceleration of zero, regardless of
how the points are defined.  Second, if the BDF integrator is used, the
integration will restart at every defined point on the curve, resulting in long
solution times.  Please consider using a different interpolation type.

Warning:  Prior to assembly the number of constraints, drivers and
initial conditions is not equal to the number of generalized
coordinates.  The assembly algorithm will be executed but the
result will represent one of several possible solutions.
Number of constraints, drivers, I.C's =                   31
Number of generalized coordinates     =                   37
