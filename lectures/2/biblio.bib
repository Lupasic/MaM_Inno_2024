  abstract = {Planetary exploration robots encounter challenging terrain during operation. Vision-based approaches have failed to reliably predict soil characteristics in the past, making it necessary to probe the terrain tactilely. We present a robust, haptic inspection approach for a variety of fine, granular media, which are representative of Martian soil. In our approach, the robot uses one limb to perform an impact trajectory, while supporting the main body with the remaining three legs. The resulting vibration, which is recorded by sensors placed in the foot, is decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and assigned a soil class by a support vector machine. We tested two foot designs and validated the robustness of this approach through the extensive use of an open-source dataset, which we recorded on a specially designed single-foot testbed. A remarkable overall classification accuracy of more than 98\% could be achieved despite various introduced disturbances. The contributions of different sensors to the classification performance are evaluated. Finally, we test the generalization performance on unknown soils and show that the interaction behavior can be anticipated.},

  abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a miniature tactile sensing array for ground reaction force measurements in small legged robots. Dynamic ground pressure data from the sensors were collected using a small two-legged runner and used to train a support vector machine (SVM) terrain classifier. Results show that tactile sensing data, in combination with information about the motor torque and robot gait, are sufficient to distinguish among hard, slippery, grassy and granular terrain types with {$>$}90\% accuracy in a single stride. The most useful classifier features include stride frequency, peak motor torque, and peak and average tactile sensor readings.},

  abstract = {For small legged robots, ground contact interactions significantly affect the dynamics and locomotion performance. In this article, we designed thin, robust capacitive tactile sensors and applied them to the feet of a small hexapod with C-shaped rotating legs. The sensors measure contact forces as the robot traverses different types of terrain including hard surfaces with high or low friction, sand, and grass. Different gaits perform best on different types of terrain. Useful measured parameters include the magnitude and timing of the peak normal forces, in combination with the leg rotational velocity. The measured parameters were used in a support vector machine classifier to identify terrain types with 82.5\% accuracy. Based on gait performance studies, we implemented a terrain-based gait control using real-time terrain classifications. A surface transitioning test shows 17.1\% increase in body speed and 13.2\% improvement in efficiency as the robot adjusts its gait.},
